- 👋 Hi, I’m @IBelleGits
- 👀 I’m interested in writing code and making music! I also like playing sports but I'm recovering from a injury right now...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Bootstrap and how to combine this with HTML. I already finished HTML/CSS and PHP and will learn Javascript in a week or 2
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing specific right now. Im still fairly new to all of this so I'm not sure what people can collaborate on tbh
- 📫 You can reach me on my e-mail: Itmmgits@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I got a cat named "Poes" which means 'cat' in english
